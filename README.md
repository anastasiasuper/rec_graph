# rec_graph
This repository contains an example of the implementation of a convolutional neural network in the task of recognizing handwritten graphs on an image.
library used - tensorflow,keras (code in rec_graph file).
create_data_g and create_data_not_g - a program that is designed to create 2 classes in the dataset - a class of graphs and non-graphs.
convert_im - implementation of the algorithm to find the boundaries of the object in the image.
